title: A rubber duck AI for writing
subtitle: An Escape from Chat?
---

As I've been writing a lot more recently, I was curious to explore the world of AI writing tools. All of them tend to have a chat interface at the side, an interface to request criticism of the text, suggestions for improvement, and with the ability for direct inline edits and completion. 

Yet, I didn't really want AI to write for me. I wanted the technique programmers often use when debugging code - a rubber duck to question what I'd written and why - and for it to do that seamlessly and automatically. Using Tiptap's templates, below is a quick prototype of an idea of how this could work - questions pop up at the side of the text as you write, to simply ask provoke and nudge your thoughts as you write.
